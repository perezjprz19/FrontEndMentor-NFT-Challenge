## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

First, I built out the body of the card based on the images while trying to stick to semantic HTML. Then, I used a mobile first approach to styling to make sure it worked well in as many screen sizes as possible.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

<ul>
  <li>Make an overlay on hover</li>
  <li>Practiced a mobile first approach</li>
  <li>practiced using a min function to set the width of my card so that it stays the same size</li>
  <li>Learned how to use the box-shadow property</li>
</ul>


### Continued development

I still want to focus more on building web pages that are responsive at any screen size. I did pretty well with everything except the overlay that goes on the image because when it gets to the smaller sizes and it overflows the size of the image.

In addition, the opacity of the ".view" is tied to the ".overlay" div, which is not what it needed to do, so I still have some work to do with that.
